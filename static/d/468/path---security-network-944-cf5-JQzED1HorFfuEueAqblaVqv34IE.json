Define what has access to each zone. Commonly used: Intranet, Internet, Extranet, Corporate, Testing Labs, Data Center.</li>\n<li>Defense in Depth - Isolate things so if you get a section breached, they only have access to that one thing.</li>\n<li>Intrusion Detection - Catches and blocks known threats</li>\n<li>Honeynets / Intrusion Deception - leave something open that we don’t care about, to see if it’s attacked</li>\n<li>Quarantine - Put you into your own network where you can’t touch anything else (ex - airport wireless logins)</li>\n<li>Reputation (also host based) - big data solution where there is a list of bad and good things that anyone can check (ex - IP addresses, URLs, files)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Network Threats</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Man in the Middle - network generates packets and needs to go through other networks. Someone can sit in the middle and change things before passing them along. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>🙁 ARP poisoning - can fool hosts into thinking the internet gateway is at your MAC address instead of the real one.</p>\n<p>🙁 TCP hijacking - inject, delete or change data in a TCP stream.</p>\n<p>🙂 Terminating TCP Proxy - terminate TCP connections on one side and create a new connection on other side or rewrite headers so an attacker can’t transmit protocol attacks.</p>\n<p>🙂 HTTP Proxy - intercept all HTTP traffic and verify destination or check for strangely encoded URLs.</p>\n<p>🙂 SSL MITM - Intercept SSL, decrypt and reencrpy </p>\n<h5>Detecting Man in the Middle</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Attach HMAC (Machine Access Code, using a crypto hash) to data. You would need to crack the HMAC to change the data. Private/Public keys are used to hash the data.</li>\n<li>You can trick people with SSL MITM by spoofing DNS or forging/stealing keys and certificates. Also, because people might not know what the browser messages are telling them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Reconnaissance</h5>\n<h6>Active</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Scanning - trying to connect to many hosts and services to get the IP address and UDP/TCP port of a service you can attack.</li>\n<li>NMAP = common tool</li>\n<li>Kinds of simple scans - Ping, TCP port scan, UDP scans (UDP data packet/ICMP Dest Unreachable)</li>\n<li>Scan for vulnerabilities - try attacking ports one by one</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Passive</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>This is generally illegal ⚠️</li>\n<li>Attacker waits and listens (Tap ISP, hide equipment, listening to radio signals)</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Defenses</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting up honeynets</li>\n<li>Checking logs</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Spoofing</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Attacker pretends to be another network entity.</li>\n<li>Can be spoofed: TCP sequence numbers, IP addresses, MAC addresses, Email addresses, HTTP fields</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on Network Security (Defense Against the Dark Arts)","date":"February 12, 2019","tags":["school","security"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/security-network/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/security-final/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on Hacking Challenges (Final for Defense Against the Dark Arts)","tags":["school","security"]}},"next":null}}
