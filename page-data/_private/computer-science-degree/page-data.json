Working full time while taking classes at the same time was a huge undertaking, very stressful, and left little time in my life for anything fun or relaxing for the past two years of my life. Balancing my time, keeping track of assignments for multiple classes at a time (my average was 2 a time, 2 quarters I took 1, and 1 quarter I took 3), and the stress of having to study and take exams again for the first time in many many years, and maintaining a high GPA, is truly an accomplishment I feel proud of.</p>\n<p>At many times, I questioned why I was doing the program. It partially began as a way to get some Computer Science classes done while contemplating applying to the GT OMSCS program, but since the classes build on one another, by the time I finished Data Structures, I was already nearly halfway through the program. The thought of 3+ more years of school vs 1.5 years of school was something I couldn’t imagine. I also considered just not finishing, but it seemed like a waste of the money and time I had put into the program already. I didn’t want it to be a sunk cost. Although many companies are becoming “woke” that you can be a successful engineer without a CS degree, many other companies are still requiring it. As a woman in tech, I already have enough stacked against me, so I wanted myself to be in the best possible position when evaluating future job opportunities. I didn’t want to be discounted just for not having it, before I could prove myself.</p>\n<p>What is a second bachelors degree? When I started doing research 2 years ago, I learned that in many states, you cannot enter a bachelor program if you already have a bachelor’s degree. </p>\n<p>I learned a lot in my classes, although nothing I couldn’t have learned on my own. There was absolutely zero motivation for me to learn these things after coming home from work exhausted. I needed the structure of classes, and money and grades as a motivation, to put in the effort. Although I still believe I could have had a fine career without this knowledge, I do think it has done wonders for my imposter’s syndrome, and I feel less likely to feel caught off guard in some computer science topics that my co-workers mention.</p>\n<p>One really interesting aspect of this program is the fact that it’s online and also since it’s a second bachelors, you have students from a diverse range of ages, occupations, locations, and experiences. Through a student run slack group, I made connections with people across the country while receiving support for the classes. Of course there were also many Slack rooms where people felt free to give their opinions. There were recurring topics that were similar to what you’d find on </p>\n<p>All the while, managing a large team and dealing with work stresses, </p>\n<p>Concept of second bs\nStigma against boot camp and degree and front end vs back end\nSchool in particular</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on getting a (second) degree in Computer Science","date":"June 15, 2019","tags":["school"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/_private/computer-science-degree/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/_private/security-mobile/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on Mobile Security (Defense Against the Dark Arts)","tags":["school","security"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/_private/being-an-ally/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Being an Ally","tags":[]}}}}}
